# igme230FinalProject
For this project I plan to create a variation on the game “Brick breaker”, using the anime.js library. The first app will be the basic version of brick breaker that you know however, for the second one I plan to add in a second paddle above the bricks. With the addition of the second paddle, I aim to increase the speed of the ball in order to increase the difficulty. For the third app, I want to further increase the difficulty by including multiple balls of varying speeds. I may change or tweak some of these ideas over the course of development as I tweak and balance the mechanics. The menu for choosing these apps, will consist of three tiles with a description of each one next to it.
	In order to implement this idea, I will need to better learn the different things that anime.js can do. From the tutorials that I’ve done already and looking at the documentation, I will need to utilize functions like transform, random, play/pause, restart, and anything else I feel may be a cool feature along the way.
