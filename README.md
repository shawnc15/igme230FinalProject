# igme230FinalProject
For this project I have created a canvas application that uses the Anime.js, JQuery, and JQueryUI libraries. The first application is a basic version, with four premade shapes and playback buttons to manipulate the animations, you also have the ability to drag the shapes around the canvas. The second application expands on the first by adding a menu that lets you generate new shapes by choosing the type of shape, color, width, height, and opacity. The third app expands on this by adding the ability to adjust the playback speed for the animations and delete all shapes currently on the canvas.
